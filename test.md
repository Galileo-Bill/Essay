The main argument for restricting the marketing of junk food to children is that this type of marketing can lead to unhealthy eating among children. Various studies have demonstrated a relationship between the amount of food marketing that children view and their preference for junk food. For instance, Smith et al. (2019) reviewed 71 research articles on the effect of marketing on children aged 18 years and under. They found that exposure to food advertising was associated with increased food consumption of and preferences for unhealthy foods. Another such study was conducted by Coates et al. (2019), who investigated the effects of food marketing on children by showing different groups fake Instagram profiles of popular Youtubers which showed the influencers with either healthy or unhealthy food, or non-food products. Results indicated that children who saw endorsements of unhealthy food tended to eat more unhealthy food than those viewing other types of information. Overall, these studies highlight the relationship between exposure to food marketing and unhealthy food attitudes and behaviors. As such, restrictions on the use of this type of marketing should be put in place as they are helpful in improving health outcomes in children.
