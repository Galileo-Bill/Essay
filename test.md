The main argument for restricting the marketing of junk food to children is that this type of marketing can lead to unhealthy eating among children. 2Research suggests that increased exposure to junk food marketing is associated with more increased desire for and consumption of unhealthy food. 3In one study, 4Smith et al. (2019) 5reviewed 71 research articles on the effect of marketing on children aged 18 years and under. 6They found that exposure to food advertising was associated with increased food consumption, and that children who saw large amounts of food marketing tended to prefer both the food they saw and unhealthy foods in general. 7In the same vein, 8Coates et al. (2019) 9investigated the effects of food marketing on children by showing different groups fake Instagram profiles of popular Youtubers which showed the influencers with either healthy or unhealthy food, or non-food products. 10Results indicated that children who saw endorsements of unhealthy food tended to eat more unhealthy food than children who saw endorsements of healthy food or non-food products. 11Together, these studies suggest that increased consumption of unhealthy food can be attributed to the influence of food marketing; 12accordingly, 13such marketing should be strictly regulated in order to promote more positive health outcomes.
