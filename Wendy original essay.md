Testing is an essential part of education." To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Nowadays, testing accounts for a large proportion of education. There is a significant debate about whether the exam is essential to education. Although some people believe testing adds too much pressure on students, testing is necessary for education to reflect on how much students have learned and encourage them to improve.

It is often argued that testing makes students stressful. This is because the majority of students want to get good grades which leads to fierce competition among them. This means testing applies pressure not only to students with poor grades. This might make them feel embarrassed but also to students with good grades which make them keep learning to prevent their classmates' overtake.

While this may be true, it is generally believed that testing is still important in education because examinations can reflect students' studying levels. **If students do not have any exams, they might not have any standards or how well they have learned which is likely to lead them to have no aims to achieve that can make students feel confused in learning.

Another important consideration is motivation. If students do not pass the exam, they might work harder to prepare for what they have lost **cores（？）** in this exam so they may get a better grade in the next time. For students who get good grades, it can probably encourage them to keep working confidently as well. Thus, examination plays an important role to motivate students to work hard.

Based on all the above arguments, it is fair to say that it is important to have tests in education. Although testing may add more tasks and pressures for students, it is more likely to reflect their study level and encourage them to work hard. Therefore, testing is essential to education. It hopes that students can have more interesting testing in the future.
